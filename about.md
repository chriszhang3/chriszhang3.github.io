Hi! I'm Christoher Zhang, and I'm a mathematician turned software engineer.

I want to record some things I have learned and share them with people who are interested. I also plan to improve the design of this webpage soon...

If you're interested in my former mathematical work, see my old [academic website](https://websites.umich.edu/~zhangchr/).
